    <h2>Recruitment</h2>
    <p>
     We are currently actively recruiting new members for the Fall of 2020.  We are looking for non-faggots unlike Brandon Cain (major fag alert).  Also fuck Tanner because he's a bitch who's whipped by his high school girlfriend.  Dillon and Dom are cool.  We call them the double D's of the house because they both have tits the size of watermelons.

    <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
    <p>
      In 2016, the brothers of Theta Delta Cahi launched Bros UniteD at the University of Washington.  Bros UniteD is an eight-week community based mentorship program for teenage boys (age 13-18) on the autism spectrum.  It is a program that is run during the fall quarter at no cost to the family, and our goal is to provide each of our "little brothers" with a safe and fun environment, where they can practice their social and communication skills.  Each weekend during the fall quarter, the "big brothers" of the fraternity will spend time to do fun activities with their "little brothers."  This past year's activities included a trip to the Woodland Park Zoo, a Nerf Gun day, bowling at the UW HUB, and much more!<br><br>
