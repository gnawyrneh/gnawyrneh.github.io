    <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
    <p>
      In 2016, the brothers of Theta Delta Cahi launched Bros UniteD at the University of Washington.  Bros UniteD is an eight-week community based mentorship program for teenage boys (age 13-18) on the autism spectrum.  It is a program that is run during the fall quarter at no cost to the family, and our goal is to provide each of our "little brothers" with a safe and fun environment, where they can practice their social and communication skills.  Each weekend during the fall quarter, the "big brothers" from the fraternity will spend time to do fun activities with their "little brothers."
